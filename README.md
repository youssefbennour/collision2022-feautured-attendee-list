# collision2022-feautured-attendee-list
This is a web scraping script for the list of attendees of Collision 2022.  
I found this task on the famous freelancing website "UpWork", however i don't happen to be accepted by them as a freelancer, so I took this task to practice my web scraping skills, and I learned about a new type of web scraping, which is by APIs.    
very basic stuff
I used:  
  Json  
  Requests  
   csv  to scrape and classify the script data in .csv file
